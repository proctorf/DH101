**Overview** --

Digital technology increasingly shapes how we communicate; how we form,
maintain, and end relationships; how we construct communities; how we
store, retrieve, and analyze information; how we organize our
time\...the list can go on and on. For students in the humanities, these
revolutionary changes have made new kinds of study possible by opening
up myriad new avenues for creativity, scholarship, and global engagement
that address the issues above. This class is an opportunity for students
to learn and play in these new spaces between traditional
humanities-based inquiry and the digital.

Digital Humanities investigates how digital formats and tools are
changing the ways that we can create and share knowledge in the
humanities. This class is an introduction to *some* of these formats and
tools.

We will focus on deeper understanding of the basic components of digital
projects -- from data to interface. We will explore the differences
between the world we experience and the world as the computer can
capture it.

**Learning Goals:**

1)  Hone our Humanities-based problem-solving skills grounded in close
    reading, thoughtful consideration, informed discussion, and clear,
    concise writing focused on intended audience

2)  Learning the basic vocabulary of concepts and tools in digital
    humanities

3)  Increasing digital literacy -- become more thoughtful, critical, and
    reflective users of digital tools and technologies

4)  Developing a deeper understanding of how all technologies are
    complex, socially situated, and political tools through which humans
    make meaning and deploy power

5)  Developing a deeper understanding of how digital technologies
    contribute to the development and maintenance of power structures
    (class, gender, racial, and other hierarchies)

6)  Building resilience and the ability to "fail" productively

7)  Develop a deeper understanding of the power and limitations of
    generative AI (Artificial Intelligence)

    a.  How does generative AI work?

    b.  What are its limitations?

    c.  What are the broader ethical implications (bias, labor
        exploitation, environmental impacts, questions of equity,
        academic integrity) of widespread AI use?

    d.  Prompt Engineering - how to best engage generative AI to produce
        meaningful and interesting responses.

**You will emerge from this class better able to:**

1)  work with structured and unstructured data

2)  create data visualizations

3)  create network graphs

4)  create digital maps

5)  effectively and ethically use generative AI

6)  understand the layers of power potentially embedded in these
    practices

**[What to Expect --]{.underline}**

The unexpected! This class will likely (hopefully) feel different than
most classes you've taken at Denison. First, rather than just reading,
discussing, and writing you will be asked to apply those skills and
content knowledge to make new things. Second, and relatedly, the class
focuses equal time on technical skills.

Thirdly, this will likely be the one of the most collaborative classes
you will take at Denison. The team who is coming together to teach the
class (six people in all) should be a signal about the collaborative
nature of the generation and presentation of knowledge in digital forms.
No one can know everything, and often the best work is produced by a
team of specialists with particular skills. Hopefully, then, this class
will help sharpen your teamwork and project management skills in
addition to the digital and humanities- based skills you will hone. In
addition, this is likely the one time in your Denison career when you
will experience faculty learning alongside you, as students, in one of
your classes.

Finally, the goal of the class is to create a "semi"-public facing,
group project. You will generate content to populate that site. This
also means that we have to be attentive to our audience(s). This should
be a different experience, and product, then a research class or
readings colloquium.

**OFFICE HOURS** -

The purpose of office hours is to make myself available to my students
to discuss our class, their assignments, and perhaps even their larger
Denison experience. I am here and ready to help/talk/listen.

I would strongly encourage you to take advantage of office hours, or to
set up an appointment. I can promise that doing so will help you be your
most effective and successful in my course.

+==========================================================+===========+

**SUBMITTING YOUR WORK** - You create a folder in your GoogleDrive space
called DH101_YourLastName (i.e. DH101_Proctor). You will then share that
folder with the teaching team. You should save ALL of your work for this
class in that folder. Most assignments will ask you to upload a link to
a GoogleDoc. If I am unable to open that file because you have not given
me access (which will happen automatically if you save it in your DH101
and share the entire folder with me) the assignment will be treated as
incomplete and you will receive a zero (0) on that assignment.

**Digital Humanities Project Critiques -** Three times relatively
throughout the semester you will be assigned a digital humanities
website to assess. You should consider the stated goals of the site;
what types of data it used; how the data was found, transformed, and
presented; what types of technologies were used. The critiques will
provide an analysis of how successful you believe the project to be in
achieving its aims, and why/why not?

We will discuss these sites in class, but we will not be doing formal
presentations. Thus, you need to come prepared to offer your general
assessment of the site and to highlight a particularly successful or
problematic element of the project/site/

**Lab Reports / Failure Logs -** "Fail Logs and Lab Notes" -- This is a
space for you to describe the work that you did for each
lab/technology/tool. What can go into this? Anything and everything.
What should go into this? A narrative of your work that connects the
dots and explains the thinking of what you did, a series of bread crumbs
that helps you work through your work; AND, a "fail log" or a
description of where things fell apart and what you did to get back on
track. You must acknowledge the collaboration and assistance you
received to address these issues.

Labs will include specific tasks beyond the work we do in class
together, demonstration of completion of those tasks will also be a
component of the lab report.

**Unit Projects -** The semester is designed around "Sherlock Holmes
Stories" and we will apply multiple different tools to our data sets
(these are the labs). You will then construct a mini-website focused on
the outcome of applying those technologies. ***Specific Instructions to
Follow.***

**Reading Responses / Discussion Boards** - Throughout the semester, I
will post questions to Notebowl for most of the readings. At times these
might be discussion boards, in other instances they will be informal
writing assignments. The goal is to demonstrate that you are completing
the readings; thinking critically about the arguments therein; and, how
they might impact our class/project. (Students will be allowed to drop
the lowest 10% of scores).

You will be graded on the thoughtfulness of your responses and the
clarity of your writing. A primary goal will be for you to demonstrate
that you have read and contemplated the reading.

**FYI - I will grade this with a high standard for full credit. Your job
is to 1) prove you read AND 2) prove that you have thought about the
implications of the reading.**

***PLEASE DO NOT USE A GENERATIVE AI CHATBOT TO COMPLETE THESE
ASSIGNMENTS, DOING SO WILL RESULT IN PARTIAL OR NO CREDIT***

***Reading Response Rubric -***

1.  100 = clear that you read and thought about the assigned reading;
    and, that you are trying to add something to the discussion. Clarity
    of writing matters.

2.  75 = evidence that you have read

3.  50 = evidence that you have pretended to read

4.  0 = no response; or, response shows no indication of engagement with
    the reading

**Late Reading Responses/Discussion Boards will not be accepted.**

**Any assignment that I cannot open (if, for example, you have not
correctly shared a Google file with me) will be treated as incomplete
and receive a zero (0) for that assignment.**

**Technical Exam** - These exams will consist of an opportunity for you
to demonstrate basic mastery of the technologies that we have learned
throughout the semester. For example, you might be asked to create a
simple webpage; to generate a visualization of a social network; to
geolocate particular places and generate a digital map; to perform a
simple text analysis of a text or set of texts; to create visualizations
of numerical data; and/or to clean and reformat a "dirty" dataset.

**Final Project -** Working in teams of five to six, students will
examine a research question using digital methods. Your group will work
to create a mini-website that explores and analyzes a dataset from
multiple angles. Each group will be tasked with dividing duties
according to member's strengths and interests, selecting appropriate
data and tools to conduct the research, and determining the deliverable
outcomes (map, network, website, etc.).

Students will be presented with a list of potential datasets to choose
from later in the semester. A group can also elect to generate their own
dataset if they so choose.

***Full Instructions for the Project and a series of stepping-stone
assignments will be provided separately.***

**[Attendance and Contribution]{.underline}**

Denison, and Digital Humanities at Denison, are about the exchange of
ideas. Rather than thinking about contribution as something for you (an
assignment), think of it as an obligation to your classmates. They
deserve for you to be prepared, engaged, and to share your ideas so that
they can more thoroughly engage the material and the major questions we
are considering.

You are expected to attend class, to have completed the assigned reading
beforehand, and to contribute to our classroom conversations. Share your
ideas, questions, thoughts and respond thoughtfully, empathetically, and
meaningfully to the ideas of others. No small task.

**Grades and Grading** - Grading is a pedagogical tool. It is meant to
signal to students where and how they can improve on meeting the
expectations for the assignments in our class. They are not a reflection
of ability, character, or effort. My comments on assignments are meant
to highlight where improvement is possible on that assignment and should
serve as guideposts for future assignments. They are not a road map to
earning "A's." That may take time and practice. And, I am here to help
you in that journey.

I believe strongly in the power of constructive criticism, so my
comments will focus on strengths I see in a particular assignment but
perhaps more so on the areas that I see where improvement is possible.

**[Contribution and Device Use Rubrics]{.underline}** - **Attendance,
contribution to in-Class learning, and Appropriate Device Use**

**A-range** - Attends all classes, arrives on time, and stays for the
entire duration. Consistently contributes to discussions in every class
with insightful, thoughtful, and relevant contributions that enhance the
discussion. Actively listens, responds to, and engages with others\'
comments, and is always respectful, encouraging, and supportive of
classmates.

**B-range** - Misses a few classes, generally punctual and present for
the full class. Regularly contributes but may not speak in every class;
contributions are relevant and show understanding of the material.
Generally listens and occasionally engages with others\' comments,
usually respectful and sometimes supports others.

**C-range** - Regularly attends but participates rarely and may be
frequently tardy. Speaks infrequently with minimal, sometimes off-topic
contributions showing basic understanding. Listens but rarely responds
to or acknowledges others, is respectful but passive and does not
actively support or collaborate with others.

**D-range** - Frequent unexplained absences, often late or leaves early.
Participates only very rarely with contributions that are often
off-topic, disruptive, or show lack of preparation. Occasionally listens
to others, may interrupt, and shows signs of disengagement. Sometimes
disrespectful or minimally collaborative.

**F-range** - Multiple unexplained absences, frequently late or leaves
early. Does not participate at all with contributions that are
off-topic, disruptive, or show a complete lack of preparation. Does not
listen to others, interrupts, or is completely disengaged. Disrespectful
or significantly disruptive to the class environment.

**[Attendance and Tardiness]{.underline}** - Attendance is mandatory in
so far as if you are not present, you cannot participate in classroom
activities and discussions. These are vitally important to your learning
experience.

Timeliness matters (especially at 830am)! I will call roll at the
beginning of class, if you are not present at that time I will mark you
as absent. Speak to me after class to mark you as late, but if this
becomes a pattern (more than 2 instances), I will no longer mark you as
late and you will be considered as having missed class.

**[Device Use Rubric for Computers, Phones, Tablets, and
Smartwatches]{.underline}**

The rubric below outlines my expectations for device use in this
classroom. Unacceptable and below expectations device use will
negatively impact your contribution grade.

**[Policies and Procedures:]{.underline}**

**Late work -** Deadlines matter! This is an important thing to
recognize. However, life happens and I want to be as supportive and
flexible as I can relative to your ability to complete your assignments
to the best of your ability and in a timely manner.

Proactivity also matters! So, rather than a formal Late Policy, I am
going to require that you be proactive. If you contact me BEFORE a
deadline to let me know that you need extra time (for whatever reason)
AND provide a reasonable alternative deadline I will not impose late
penalties.

However, if you are not proactive, and simply turn in an assignment
late, I will impose late penalties as follows - unexplained late papers
will be penalized one full letter grade on the day following the due
date (A to B) and one third of a letter grade (B to B-) for each day
after that.

Missed assignments will be assigned a score of zero (0).

Late informal assignments will not be accepted.

**[Academic Integrity]{.underline}: Please do your own work. Plagiarism
will not be tolerated in any form.** The students and faculty of Denison
University are committed to academic integrity and will not tolerate any
violation of this principle.  Academic honesty, the cornerstone of
teaching and learning, lays the foundation for lifelong integrity.
![AI_logo_bw](media/image1.jpg){width="1.125in" height="1.65625in"}

Academic dishonesty is, in most cases, intellectual theft. It includes,
but is not limited to, providing or receiving assistance in a manner not
authorized by the instructor in the creation of work to be submitted for
evaluation. This standard applies to all work ranging from daily
homework assignments to major exams. Students must clearly cite any
sources consulted---not only for quoted phrases but also for ideas and
information that are not common knowledge. Neither ignorance nor
carelessness is an acceptable defense in cases of plagiarism. It is the
student's responsibility to follow the appropriate format for citations.
Students should ask the professor for assistance in determining what
sorts of materials and assistance are appropriate for assignments and
for guidance in citing such materials clearly.

Proposed and developed by Denison students, passed unanimously by DCGA
and Denison's faculty, the **Code of Academic Integrity** requires that
instructors notify the Associate Provost of cases of academic
dishonesty, and it requires that cases be heard by the Academic
Integrity Board. Further, the code makes students responsible for
promoting a culture of integrity on campus and acting in instances in
which integrity is violated. The punishment for plagiarism/academic
dishonesty in this class will be a grade of zero for the assignment in
question and potentially a failing grade for the course in egregious
cases.

[**Disability Statement**:]{.underline} Any student who feels he or she
may need an accommodation based on the impact of a disability should
contact me privately as soon as possible to discuss his or her specific
needs. I rely on the Academic Support & Enrichment Center in 104 Doane
to verify the need for reasonable accommodations.

[**Writing Center**:]{.underline} The Center is a free resource
available to all Denison students.  Student writing consultants from
many majors help writers one-on-one in all phases of the writing
process, from deciphering the assignment, to discussing ideas, to
developing an argument, to finalizing a draft.  Please visit the Writing
Center Website at
[[http://www.denison.edu/writingctr/]{.underline}](http://www.denison.edu/writingctr/)
for locations and hours.

**[L2 or Multilingual Support]{.underline}:** In addition to the
academic support services available to all Denison students, students
who use English in addition to other languages can meet with Denison's
Coordinator of Multilingual Learning, Kalynda Thayer. If English is not
your first or only language, please consider utilizing this resource,
which is available to ALL Denison students. Ms. Thayer offers a variety
of support for L2 students, including consulting with you about your
written language (grammar, syntax, word-choices), strategies to manage
your reading assignments, assistance with class conversation and
presentations, and to help devising ways to develop and effectively use
all your skills in English. You can email her at thayerk@denison.edu to
schedule an appointment.

**[The course adheres to Denison's Academic Credit
Policy]{.underline}:** Significant feedback on writing is a core
component of this course. Students are expected to review instructor
feedback and reflect on how to incorporate that into their future work.
Students will be required to complete pre- or post-writing assignments
before and after official course meetings. In addition, students will
complete group assignments and they are expected to meet together with
their group mates and with the professor for guidance on group projects
throughout the semester.

[**Classroom Etiquette**:]{.underline} Please arrive to class on time,
and please turn off and put away your phones. Any student found using
any form of social media on their phones or computers during class will
be asked to leave.

|                                                                       |
| The development of generative AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Bard are   |
| transforming the landscape of higher education. With that reality in  |
| mind, here are some guiding principles for the use of AI **in our     |
| course** (other faculty may have different policies, and it is YOUR   |
| responsibility to know what each of your professors determine is the  |
| acceptable and ethical use of AI in their courses).                   |
|                                                                       |
| AI can be a powerful tutor and instructor for many of the tools we    |
| will be exploring this semester. It is acceptable to you to use AI as |
| an assistant in this regard, but it is extremely important that you   |
| clearly state how and why you used AI in your assignments.            |
|                                                                       |
| - RECOGNIZE that my primary interest is to know what YOU THINK about  |
|   the materials I have assigned. (I don't care what a computer might  |
|   produce as representing the "hive mind" or "groupthink " best       |
|   answer to a question based on what others have written.)            |
|                                                                       |
|   - AI might be appropriate as a piece of the process of identifying  |
|     a topic and theme to write your papers on. It might be helpful to |
|     identify the author and their historical context to better        |
|     understand your source(s). But, it **should not be used** to      |
|     produce the final product (Please don't ask AI to "write a paper" |
|     for you, you're only cheating yourself)                           |
|                                                                       |
|   - If you consult AI, Academic Integrity requires that you           |
|     ACKNOWLEDGE such use to your readers. Do so in a footnote. In a   |
|     sentence, explain your use of AI and identify the tool(s) you     |
|     consulted.                                                        |
|                                                                       |
|     - Do not CITE AI. Citations are meant to identify the work of     |
|       other humans that you have consulted, and to provide a clear    |
